# Developer Notes

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The name of the game is Contra
I dunno what to write... 
A hard game?
A game where you solve puzzles to get the code to unlock the secrets in the browsers...
I think.... I was suppose to create a similiar game to contra but it is difficult when you're using a framework KEKW. Will do a proper contra game with vanilla JS("Someday").
